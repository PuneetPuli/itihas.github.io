    <h1>A history of Indian horse breeds and reasons for their decline.</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <pre>
                One of the great tragedies of being human is the fact that I am limited by my time, resources, and compulsions with respect to the amount of research 
            I can peform. This article particularly focuses on the horse breeds of the Deccan plateau. When most people think of Indian horses, their minds jump to 
            the north-west. The hardy Kathiawari of the Kathi people, the robust breeds of the Punjab, the regal Marwari of Rajasthan, etc. are some breeds that 
            come to mind. However, the Indian subcontinent is home to a variety of different equestrian cultures that have ancient origins. The Sino-Tibetians of
            Ladakh, Manipur, Himachal, etc. have bred robust horses that thrive in the cold, high altitude mountains of the himalayas. In fact, the popular sport 
            derives its name from the Manipuri word 'polu'. 

                As such, the Indian subcontinent was home to numerous equestrian cultures stretching north to south, and east to west. However, in my opinion, one
            of the least understood, and appreciated equestrian cultures comes from the Deccan plateau. A long time ago, horses, and horsemen, reigned supreme.
            From the Marathas to the Sultans of Mysore, many dynasties' fate depended on the effectiveness of their horsemen, and their horses. In modern times,
            there are some scant references to these bygone times. Names, places, and certain castes bear marks of this great history. As an avid military history
            enthusiast, I could not resist temptation to research and cover this more or less forgotten equestrian culture of India.

                Archaeological evidence suggests that horse implements were present in the southern Megalithic culture, with estimates dating them between 800-300 BCE. 
            Horses played a crucial role in warfare, and many southern Indian and Deccan kingdoms relied on them in combat. Their significance is evident in temple carvings
            and hero stones, which commemorate fallen warriors. The increasing importance of cavalry in the Deccan and southern India was driven by military doctrines introduced 
            with the arrival of the Turks. Previously, war elephants were the primary battle animals, but Turkic invasions of northern and central India underscored the advantages 
            of a highly mobile cavalry force, leading to widespread adoption of mounted troops.

    <h2>A story of decline, and negligence.</h2>
    <pre>
            The decline of indigenous horse breeds in the Deccan region mirrors a broader narrative of cultural transformation. During the times of the Deccan Sultanates 
        and the Maratha Empire, local breeds were highly valued, with significant efforts made to maintain and improve them. However, the decline truly began when the
        British occupied large sections of the Deccan, either by annexation through the East India Company or by subordinating local rulers. This shift reduced the military 
        demand for horses, leading to the deterioration of native breeds.

            Horse breeding in the Deccan faced significant challenges. Captain Henry Shakespeare of the Nagpur Irregular Force remarked on the lack of suitable grazing lands, stating, 
        "The great drawback to breeding horses in this country is the want of proper grazing meadows. The great changes in the seasons here, making the ground at one time a swamp, 
        and at another parched and cracked and hard as iron, so that no grass can exist upon it, are almost insurmountable difficulties to having good grazing paddocks." Similarly, 
        Marco Polo noted that the Pandyan Kingdom had to import horses at great expense due to the absence of local breeding.
