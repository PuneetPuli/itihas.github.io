    <h1>A history of Indian horse breeds and reasons for their decline.</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <pre>
                One of the great tragedies of being human is the fact that I am limited by my time, resources, and compulsions with respect to the amount of research 
            I can peform. This article particularly focuses on the horse breeds of the Deccan plateau. When most people think of Indian horses, their minds jump to 
            the north-west. The hardy Kathiawari of the Kathi people, the robust breeds of the Punjab, the regal Marwari of Rajasthan, etc. are some breeds that 
            come to mind. However, the Indian subcontinent is home to a variety of different equestrian cultures that have ancient origins. The Sino-Tibetians of
            Ladakh, Manipur, Himachal, etc. have bred robust horses that thrive in the cold, high altitude mountains of the himalayas. In fact, the popular sport 
            derives its name from the Manipuri word 'polu'. 

                As such, the Indian subcontinent was home to numerous equestrian cultures stretching north to south, and east to west. However, in my opinion, one
            of the least understood, and appreciated equestrian cultures comes from the Deccan plateau. A long time ago, horses, and horsemen, reigned supreme.
            From the Marathas to the Sultans of Mysore, many dynasties' fate depended on the effectiveness of their horsemen, and their horses. In modern times,
            there are some scant references to these bygone times. Names, places, and certain castes bear marks of this great history. As an avid military history
            enthusiast, I could not resist temptation to research and cover this more or less forgotten equestrian culture of India.
